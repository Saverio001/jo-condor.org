    You know, Javascript is not an elegant language.  
    But it can work.  

    After all, nobody ever died playing with the Javascript console.   
    Right?

It was the silence that startled me. Eli was not used to work in silence.  
He was always chattering, singing, talking to itself, cheerfully.
How he was looking at his screen in horror, his face pale, motionless like a corpse.

*"Eli? Are you OK?"*

"You know the website's pages have a footer, right?" he whispered, his fingers trembling over the keyboard. "In the footer, it asks you a question." 
I scoffed. "Yeah, some survey I think. Who cares?"  
Eli’s eyes were wide. "I answered the question". 

A cold draft slithered through the room. The monitor flickered.  

"I answered that question… but from another page."  

*"And now we are all in trouble."*  

The words hung in the air like a guillotine’s blade.  

Then—the screen went black.   

A single line of text pulsed in crimson:  

**"You broke the rules."**  

The walls groaned. The lights dimmed. 

From the speakers, a chorus of whispers rose—thousands of voices, all repeating indecipherable error codes, over and over.  

I grabbed Eli’s arm. 

"What did you do?"  

**"What did you do?"**

He swallowed hard. "I opened the console, and answered *No*.. from another page."

A deafening *click* echoed through the house. The front door unlocked itself.  

Something was coming... 

Something that should not exist, like Automatic Semicolon Insertion.

Something had just found its way in.

And it wanted its answer *correctly this time*.
