Yellow corn meal polenta with sausages.

This is the original recipe as reported by [Pellegrino Artusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellegrino_Artusi) 
in his [1891 cookbook](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_scienza_in_cucina_e_l%27arte_di_mangiar_bene)

Make a fairly soft polenta with cornmeal, spread it
on a pastry board to the thickness of a finger and cut it into almond shapes.

Place several whole sausages in a small pan with a drop of water
and when they are cooked, peel them, crumble them and add sauce or
tinned tomatoes.

Place the polenta in an ovenproof dish or tray,
season it with Parmesan cheese, the sausages and a few pieces
of butter scattered here and there, then place it between two heat sources and when it is
hot, serve it, especially as a first course for a substantial breakfast. 

This polenta can also be made hard so that it can be cut into slices.
