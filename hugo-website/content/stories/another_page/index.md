"You know the website's pages have a footer, right?" whispered Eli, his fingers trembling over the keyboard. "In the footer, it asks you a question."  

I scoffed. "Yeah, some dumb survey thing. Who cares?"  

Eli’s eyes were wide. "I answered that question… but from another page."  

A cold draft slithered through the room. The monitor flickered.  

"And now we are all in trouble."  

The words hung in the air like a guillotine’s blade. Then—the screen went black. A single line of text pulsed in crimson:  

**"You broke the rules."**  

The walls groaned. The lights dimmed. From the speakers, a chorus of whispers rose—thousands of voices, all repeating the same question from the footer, over and over.  

I grabbed Eli’s arm. "What did you *do*?"  

He swallowed hard. "I answered *No*"
A deafening *click* echoed through the house. The front door unlocked itself.  

Something was coming inside.  

And it wanted its answer *correctly this time*.
