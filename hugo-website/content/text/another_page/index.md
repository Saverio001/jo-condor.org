    You know Javascript, is not an elegant language.  
    But it can work.  

    After all, nobody ever died playing with the Javascript console.   
    Right?

It was the silence that drew my attention first. Eli was not somebody used to work in silence.  
He was always chattering, singing, talking to itself - as if he had some irrational fear of silence.

How he was looking at his screen in horror, his face pale, motionless like a corpse.

"You know the website's pages have a footer, right?" he whispered, his fingers trembling over the keyboard. "In the footer, it asks you a question."  

I scoffed. "Yeah, some dumb survey thing. Who cares?"  

Eli’s eyes were wide. "I answered that question… but from another page."  

A cold draft slithered through the room. The monitor flickered.  

*"And now we are all in trouble."*  

The words hung in the air like a guillotine’s blade.  

Then—the screen went black.   

A single line of text pulsed in crimson:  

**"You broke the rules."**  

The walls groaned. The lights dimmed. 

From the speakers, a chorus of whispers rose—thousands of voices, all repeating indecipherable error codes, over and over.  

I grabbed Eli’s arm. 

"What did you do?"  

**"What did you do?"**

He swallowed hard. "I opened the console, and answered *No*"

A deafening *click* echoed through the house. The front door unlocked itself.  

Something was coming... inside. Into this world.

Something that should not exist, like Automatic Semicolon Insertion.

Something which had just found its way in.

And it wanted its answer *correctly this time*.
