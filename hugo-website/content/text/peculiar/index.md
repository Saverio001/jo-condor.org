All these texts share one peculiar commonality: they are all incredibly boring. 

<!--more-->

Each of them tells you nothing, and leaves you in exactly the same state of mind as before.

You would not be able to recall what each was about - much less, *why was it even there*.  
They are the white noise of the written word. They mean nothing because *they are not supposed to mean anything*.

So the question to ask is not "what does it mean", but "*who* put it there and *why*"".  
Not "who could be reading this", but *"why would anybody be reading this?"*. 

These are probably the most relevant questions to ask.

Please take a moment and answer them as they will help you plan the next step.
