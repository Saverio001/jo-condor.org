All these texts share one peculiar commonality: they are all incredibly boring. 
Each of them tells you nothing, and leaves you in exactly the same state of mind as before.
You would not be able to recall what each was about - much less, *why was it even there*.  

They are the white noise of the written word.  
They mean nothing because *they are not supposed to mean anything*.

Clearly, wondering about the meaning of what has explicitly been
designed to have none is a fool's errand. 

But there are still valuable insights to be gained, if we just shift our
perspective away from the content of the texts themselves.


As an example, a question to ask is not "what does it mean", but "*who* put it there and *why*"".  
Not "who could be reading this", but *"why would anybody be reading this?"*. 

Please take a moment and answer them as they will help you plan the next step.
