Its artistry and innovation trickle down, influencing everyday wear and empowering self-expression across all walks of life. It is a universal language of boldness, imagination, and individuality.

But beneath the dazzle the message is anything but subtle. 
Love it or hate it, this dress will be talked about – but is that enough to elevate it to true haute couture?
