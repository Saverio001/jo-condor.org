Sometimes you come across some texts that share one peculiar commonality: they are all incredibly boring.   

Each of them tells you nothing, and leaves you in exactly the same state of mind as before.
You would not be able to recall what each was about - much less, *why was it even there*.  
They mean nothing, in a very deliberate way: *as if they were designed not to mean anything*.

They are the white noise of the written word.  

Wondering about the meaning of what has explicitly been
designed to have no meaning is a fool's errand.
Where does this leave us, then?
One valuable clue is, if there are any insights to be gained,
it could be useful to change our perspective.

Regardless from its content, any text always carry important questions of **agency** and **intentionality**:

- "Who is responsible for the events, ideas, or words here?"
- "Why was this written? What is it trying to achieve?"
- "What underlying beliefs, biases, or assumptions drive it?"

As an example, a question to ask would not be "what does it mean", but "*who* put it there and *why*"".  

Not "What is its audience?", but *"What could their motivations be?*". 

It is always useful to pause, just for a moment, thinking about these questions.

Texts are never neutral: they inherently involve questions of who acts and why, shaping how we engage with meaning.
